So after i trained it on maybe 30 different stocks, it started to do weird things i.e. it didnt actually write predictions
to the graph, no clue why. So I ran it again with the original 7 or 8 symbols and it works very nicely as you can see from
the graphs as they progress. Maybe the secret is...don't train it too much...?
