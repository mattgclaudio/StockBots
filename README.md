# rabbitMQMerged
Code for database VM, stores username as well as hashed passwords, stored in binary though sha1 outputs a hex value. Only returns the userid of the user to the web server which pairs with a set of confidential trading keys assigned to the user's API account for trading. Trading keys pulled from DMZ's keyring.ini with the user's UID. Runs a RabbitMQ Server waiting for DB auth requests. Runs as a systemd service, see userDB.service.
