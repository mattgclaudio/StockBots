All the dmz box's files live here, namely dmzServer.php, the assorted scripts kept in /scripts, as well as the bots which live in this top folder so they can access the python venv they need to run. Venv is configured with pip to have all the necessary packages to support the tensorflow functions. that would be a much, much longer README. 

that venv must be set up with pip to have all the packages the scripts need,
tensorflow and matlab being some of the biggest. Also needs the twilio code for sending the text messages.
