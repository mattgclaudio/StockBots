 apache2.conf goes in /etc/apache2/
stockTracker.conf is linked in etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ from its spot in sites-available

get_host_info.inc, host.ini, local.ini, path.inc, rabbitMqlib.inc, ServerClient.php, and rabbit.ini all go in a directory
for reaching out to the rabbitmqServer with user requests. it is referred to in login.php as a require once line early on. 

login.php, index.html, stylesheet all go in /var/www/html/[directory consistent with config files]

I was having trouble running queries to the dmz after logging in, even though i thought i wrote a control statement correctly, when i ran a separate form the authentication
process would try to run again and throw an error on the database server. So right now the buttons available to query the dmz are on the login.php page but
pressing them sends the user to action.php. now that im writing this im kindve thinking i know what may be wrong so i might cut this off now.
